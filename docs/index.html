	<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p> Hexapod robot is a mechanical vehicle that walks on six legs. Since a robot can be statically stable on three or more legs, a hexapod robot has a great deal of flexibility in how it can move. If legs become disabled, the robot may still be able to walk.<br> 
Furthermore, not all of the robot's legs are needed for stability; other legs are free to reach new foot placements or manipulate a payload.<br>
Many hexapod robots are biologically inspired by Hexapoda locomotion. Hexapods may be used to test biological theories about insect locomotion, motor control, and neurobiology.
