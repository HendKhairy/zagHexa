<h1>ZagHexa Assembly Guide</h1>
<p>This section is going to show you how to build ZagHexa, the six-legged robot platform. The robot can also be made fully autonomous with the addition of a few sensors and a little reprogramming.</p>




<h2>Step 1: CAD Model</h2>

Using SolidWorks, we created a CAD model of the robot so we could position components easily and determine the location of holes for the bolts that connect the legs and linkages of the robot to the frame. 

A folder of part, assembly, and drawing files for the robot can be downloaded from our github reposatory (link below). You will need SolidWorks to open the various files. There are some .pdf drawings in the folder as well, and these are also available to download in subsequent steps of this report.


<h2>Step 2: Materials</h2>

Here is a list of the materials you will need to construct the robot:



<h2>Step 3: Cut and Drill the Metal</h2>

After procuring the metal, you can begin cutting and drilling the various components, which is a pretty time consuming task.


<h2>Step 4: Prepare Motors for Mounting</h2>



<h2>Step 5: Prepare the Legs for Moutning</h2>



<h2>Step 6: Begin the Assembly</h2>


<h2>Step 7: Electronics Assembly and Wiring</h2>


<h2>Step 8: Add Batteries and Safety Features</h2>
